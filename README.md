1.	Creating Input Component and Add Button:
•	I created an input component where users can enter their todo items.
•	An "Add" button is placed next to the input field to submit the entered todo item.

2.	Submitting Todo Items:
•	When the user clicks the "Add" button, the entered todo item is submitted and added to the todo list.

3.	Displaying Todos:
•	After submitting a todo item, it is displayed in the todo list.

4.	Modules For Styling:
•	I've used separate CSS files or CSS-in-JS libraries like styled-components to style your components.

5.	Creating Header & Styling It:
•	I created a header component for my Todo app.
•	Applied styling to the header component to enhance its appearance.

6.	Separating JSX Into Components:
•	JSX code is divided into separate components for better organization and maintainability.

7.	Styling The Form:
•	Applied CSS or styling techniques to the input form to improve its appearance and make it visually appealing.

8.	Styling Todo Items:
•	Styled the individual todo items in the list to differentiate them from each other and make them more readable.

9.	Adding A Delete Button and Delete Functionality:
•	A delete button is added to each todo item.
•	Implement functionality so that when the delete button is clicked, the corresponding todo item is removed from the list.

10.	Adding Complete Task and Marking Todo Items As Complete:
•	Added functionality to mark todo items as complete.
•	implemented a striked out to indicate completion status.
•	Applied styles to visually distinguish between completed and incomplete todo items.

11.	Counting Completed & Total Todos:
•	Implemented logic to count the total number of todo items.
•	Calculated the number of completed todo items.
•	Displayed these counts to the user in the footer of the todo list.

12.	Sorting Items In A Todo List:
•	Implemented functionality to sort todo items completion marked will go down in order.
•	I did strike out on items then it will sort and come down in order.
•	Updated the display to reflect the sorted order of todo items.

By implementing these features, I've created a comprehensive Todo app in React that allows users to manage their tasks effectively. Each feature enhances the 
functionality and usability of the app, providing a smooth user experience.
